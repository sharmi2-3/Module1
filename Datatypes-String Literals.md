# 1e.Datatypes-Printing vowels in Python using character literals.

##  Aim
To write a Python program that reads a character input and prints the vowel using a character literal.

##  Algorithm
1.Accept a character from the user.
2.Check if the character is one of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u).
3.If it is a vowel, print the same character.
4.End the program.

##  Program
```
a=input()
b=input()
a=a.upper()
b=b.upper()
if a in 'AEIOU':
    print(a)
if b in 'AEIOU':
    print(b)
```

## Output

## Result
The program successfully accepts a character from the user, checks whether it is a vowel, and prints the vowel as required.
