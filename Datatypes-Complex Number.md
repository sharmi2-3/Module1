# Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

##  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `c1` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `c2` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `sum` using the `complex(c1, c2)` function.
4. Print the complex number `sum`.
5. Print the real part of `sum` using `sum.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `sum` using `sum.imag`.

##  Program
```
c1=2+3j
c2=4+7j
sum=c1+c2
print(sum)
```

## Result
The program successfully adds the two complex numbers c1 and c2 and prints their
